Install Notes for Flashing MicroPython on Sonoff WiFi Switch

**Read these instructions first. They help with FTDI connections. 
https://medium.com/cloud4rpi/getting-micropython-on-a-sonoff-smart-switch-1df6c071720a

**You will need a FDTI USB adapter. The one I used:
HiLetgo FT232RL FTDI Mini USB to TTL Serial Converter Adapter Module 
Got it from Amazon.


1. download esptool -> $ pip install esptool

2. download latest micropython firmware -> http://micropython.org/download
    Current version - esp8266-20190125-v1.10.bin

3. With power disconnected, hold down the button, while holing down the button,
   plug in the usb cable to the computer and continue to hold for 3 seconds. This puts the device in flash mode.
   
   ** line voltage to the sonoff is not necessary for any step in this process. The device will be powered from
   the 3.3v of the FTDI adapter.
   
4. $ esptool.py --port [USB adapter com port] erase_flash
    in my case: esptool.py --port COM22 erase_flash
  
5. After erase is completed, unplug usb from computer, and put the device in flash mode again.

6. $ esptool.py --port [USB adapter com port] write_flash -fs 1MB -fm dout 0x0 [path to firmware .bin file]
    in my case: esptool.py --port COM22 write_flash -fs 1MB -fm dout 0x0 C:\uPyCraft\esp8266-20190125-v1.10.bin
    
    ^^ THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT ^^
  All the instructions I found online use a different command to install the firmware but because of the manufacurer
  of the chip used by Sonoff the command below is the correct one to use.
  
  
  
    
You should be cooking with propane now!

- uPyCraft IDE for MicroPython:
  ** I was not able to get the firmware update feature of this IDE to work. Most likely because of the special esptool command
    needed to flash firmware.
